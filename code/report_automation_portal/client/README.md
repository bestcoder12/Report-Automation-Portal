# Client-side or frontend of Report Automation portal

The frontend of the project uses React library.

The frontend includes various components such as Login Page, Sidebar, Add Report, Manage Users among others.

The users first need to login to access any of the other pages and thus the login page is the landing page and when logged in successfully, the other pages are accessible. 

And if the login fails and still the user tries to access the other pages, he/she is redirected to the Unauthorized page.
